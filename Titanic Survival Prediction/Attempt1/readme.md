## Machine Learning Project : Titanic Survival Exploration

This project contains create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex, age, sibsp, embarrked and cabin class which accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

Software and Libraries:
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Decision Tree (scratch and sklearn both implementation) 
- Random Forest Classifier 
- Label Encoder 
- Ipython
- Graphviz


Predictions have an accuracy of 83.20%
